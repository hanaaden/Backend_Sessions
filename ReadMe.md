# Full Backend Learning Repository

Welcome to this repository! 🎉  

Here, you will learn and explore **full backend development** using modern technologies and best practices. This repo is designed to guide you through **Express.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, middleware, authentication, and more**.

---

## **What You Will Learn**

This repository contains multiple branches, each focusing on a different part of backend development. By exploring this repo, you will learn:

1. **Express.js** – Building scalable backend servers and APIs  
2. **TypeScript** – Strongly-typed JavaScript for safer, maintainable code  
3. **Middleware** – How to use and create middleware for validation, authentication, and logging  
4. **Authentication** – Using bcrypt for password hashing and secure login  
5. **Database Integration** – Connecting Express with PostgreSQL (`pg`)  
6. **Environment Variables** – Using `dotenv` for configuration  
7. **Routing and Controllers** – Organizing backend code in a clean, maintainable way  
8. **Error Handling** – Sending proper responses and handling errors gracefully  
9. **Full CRUD Operations** – Create, Read, Update, Delete in backend APIs  
10. **Branch Organization** – How to structure a backend project with separate branches for different features or modules

## **Branches Overview**

| Branch Name     | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `main`          | The base branch with full backend learning overview |
| `d.01`          | Students database using PostgreSQL |
| `d.02`          | Express + TypeScript basic server setup |
| `d.03`          | Express + PostgreSQL backend with controllers and routes |
| `d.04`          | Middleware examples: age check, validation, authentication |

> Each branch is designed to teach a specific backend concept step by step.
