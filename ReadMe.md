## Authentication
is verifying the person by its username or password 
What is preventing is unauthorized access 

## Authorization 
is like the permission 
So it determines the rights of accessing the system 

So the authentication is who are you while authorization is what permission do you have It requires the user’s privileges or security levels.

## CI/CD 
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment.

An automated build & test pipeline runs immediately, giving quick feedback. 

Delivery: After CI, the artifact is automatically prepared to be released (to a staging/test environment) and can be pushed to production manually.

Continuous Delivery prepares these verified builds for release, while Continuous Deployment automatically pushes them to production when tests pass.

## database
 is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It stores information in a structured way, often using tables with rows and columns (like a spreadsheet), so that users and applications can quickly find and work with the data. Databases are managed using a Database Management System (DBMS) such as MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL

## MVC Framework

Is Model view controller 

three main logical components Model, View, and Controller.

MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development frameworks to create scalable and extensible projects.

The main goal of this design pattern was to solve the problem of users controlling a large and complex data

So its all about splitting the complex data 

It provides a clear separation of business logic, UI logic, and input logic.

### Managing monitoring security 

Managing means organizing, updating, and maintaining the database so it runs smoothly 

Monitoring involves continuously checking the database’s health and performance

Security focuses on protecting the database from unauthorized access
## Production
 It’s the final stage after development and testing, where the system must run reliably and securely.
